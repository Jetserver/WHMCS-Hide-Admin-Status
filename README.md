# WHMCS-Hide-Admin-Status

This WHMCS Addon module can hide your logged in status from your staff members. This can be very useful when you want to quietly login without other staff members to notice.

Once logged in, you will be automatically hidden from other members for 5 minutes (adjustable), and you will be asked for the desired status: Stay hidden, or cancel it.

# Installation

Upload the folder "hideadmin" to your WHMCS Addon modules folder, and unzip the file.

Full path after unzip: “modules/addons/hideadmin“.

Login to your WHMCS as admin user, and navigate to “Setup” -> “Addon modules“.
Find the “Hide Admin” module, and activate it.

Set access control, Save your changes and your module is all set.

Final step will be to choose the admins that will be hidden. This can be done throught the  module’s configuration tab:
“WHMCS Admin Top Menu” -> “Addons” -> “Jetserver Hide Admin“.
